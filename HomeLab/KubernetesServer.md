# Kubernetes Server #

## Overview ##

Get my big server running Kernel Virtual Machines (KVM) so I can use it to host Kubernetes / Docker. This will be so I can spin things up / blow them away without a ton of reconfiguration, ton of Azure spend, or bunch of RaspberryPi's (currently).

I would like everything to be repeatable as much as possible (e.g. Ansible config or other) so the server isn't a snowflake. Essentially, I would like to wipe the server and repeat if needed.
