# Nutrition Basics #

Things I've learned about nutrition for fitness and how I apply them.

## My Key Tenants ##

### 1. This is a Lifestyle ###

This is not a diet. It is a lifestyle. Things may ebb and flow as you adjust to meet certain goals, but you **must** find something that works for you long term. Not long enough to lose 10 pounds. Feed your soul occasionally (e.g. holidays and birthdays) but NOT every weekend.

### 2. Make what you eat work for you ###

If you beat yourself up for every slip or 'being bad' you will hate yourself and it will lead back to bad habits. Make the food you eat work for you. Even if it is traditionally 'bad', make is work. Use that carbs and fat from the donut to push through a lift. Use the calcium and protein from ice cream or a burger post workout to fulfill protein needs. Don't make it a habit, but also don't feel like eating things you enjoy means you 'failed'. Failing is letting those choices defeat you and cause you to slide.

### 3. Reduce Processed Wherever Possible ###

### 4. Eat your Vegetables ###

## Macros ##

I enjoy 'If it fits your macros'. It isn't for everyone, but it works for me because I like to expiriment and see how changing ratios makes me feel. 

If it fits your macros breaks all foods down into Carbs, Fats, and Protein. You have a set target for each every day. Make sure you hit your protein and get close on the others (but not over). 

### Carbs ###

- 4 Calories per Gram
- 'Snacky' type food
  - rice
  - bread
  - chips
  - carrots
- Your body uses this first as energy so it's good before a workout
- Carbs are not evil, you need them for a good workout

### Fats ###

## My Observations ###

### Carbs and Fiber ###

- Gram for Gram carbs are typically about the same amount of calorie density (e.g. white vs brown rice) the problem is more processed / less fiberous carbs fill you up less and release sugars faster. Choose fiberous for meals, snacks, and fat loss. Use less fiberous before a workout for digestion

### Caffine ###

- I love caffine, and it does good for me when timed correctly. I use it in the morning to get up and also about 30 minutes before a workout to help get a bit of energy boost
- Affects ability to sleep. Avoid at least 3 hours before bed.

### Alcohol ###

- Alcohol means double the calories. Your body uses it first and it is empty from any nutritional value. It also leads me to eating more than I should. Abstain or moderate wherever possible.
- Affects the brainwaves that allow you to get good sleep. You need to sleep well to build muscle. Avoid alcohol at least 3 hours before bed.
