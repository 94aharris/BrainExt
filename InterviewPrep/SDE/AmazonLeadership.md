# Amazon Leadership

## Customer Obsession

> Leaders start with the customer and work backwards They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers

**Prioritize the customer not profit** very important to remember

## Ownership

> Leaders are owners. They think long term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They never say "That's not my job"

Everyone owns ssomething and as the owner you are responsible when something goes wrong

## Invent and Simplify

> Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by "not invented here". As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time

Don't say "I can't think of another solution" because **there is always another solution**

The simplist solution is one you can maintain, iterate on, cheapest to build, etc.

MVP

## Are Right, A Lot

> Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their belief

Like people with good instints who **listen and value other perspectives**

## Learn and Be Curious

> Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them

"Tell me something interesting you've learned recently"

## Hire and Develop the Best

> Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others

teaching others is a critical skill

## Insist on the Highest Standards

> Leaders have relentlessly high standards -- many people think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and driving their teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line.

Never be satisfied with what you have. We are **never done**

## Think Big

> Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers

Only problem is **not thinking big enough**

## Bias for Action

> Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.

Be quick and be decisive.

## Frugality

> Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size or fixed expense

Provide as much value as possible for little cost.

## Earn Trust

> Leaders listen attenttively, speak candidly and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team's body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.

be **vocally self-critical**. It's important to explain you have made mistakes.

## Dive Deep

> Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ

"Trust but verify". Keep a careful eye on what you own and know ways to audit the space. If something doesn't make sense, we need to have the ability to dive in and figure out what's wrong

## Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit

> Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge diecisions when thye disagree. Even when doing so is uncommon or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not comprise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

We do things because it's the decision we've made and with the the data we've gathered, we commit to that plan.

## Deliver Results

> Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle

We need to deliver value

## Strive to be Earth's Best Employer

> Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing work environment. Lead with empathy, have fun at work, and make it easy for others to have fun. Leaders ask themselves: Are my fellow employees growing? Are they empowered? Are they ready for what's next?

## Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility

> We are big, we impact the world, and we are far from perfect. We must be humble and thoughtful about even the secondary effects of our actions. Our local communities, planet, and future generations need us to be better every day. We must begin each day with a determination to make better, do better, and be better for our customers. Leaders create more than they consume.
