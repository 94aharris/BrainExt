## Interview Overview ##

- Different errors matter differently
  - linkedlist.add() vs linkedlist.insert()
    - Not as bad, just means you don't use linkedlist methods all the time
  - Mistaking = and ==
    - Bad, you don't code often. Mistaking assignment vs comparison

- Practice Whiteboard coding with someone in the room
- If you notice you are quiet, take a step back and say your thought proccess, otherwise the interviewer may try to give you a hint
- Say **something**, even if it is just mumbles
