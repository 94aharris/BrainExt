## How to Study ##

Derived from [Retaining Computer Science Knowledge](https://startupnextdoor.com/retaining-computer-science-knowledge/)

* Watch a few hours of videos / reading
* Implement the Algos, Data Struts, and Concepts
* Take Notes / Make flash cards for the important bits
* **Move on to the next topic**
* Reivew the flash cards / nottes laters
* After a few days go back and watch a short video on the old topic
* after another week watch a video about the old topic
* Keep reviewing flash cards / notes


Repetition is key, not reinforcing what you just learned

Go back through all notes and turn them into flash cards
