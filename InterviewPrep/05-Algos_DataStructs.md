## Big O ##

Space and time complexity of a solution as the input (n) gets larger. The 'Worse Case'

### O(1) - Constant Time ###

- constant time to run algorithm
- Math equations
- Print statements
- Hash access

### O(n) - Linear Time ###

- Time increases at same pace as input
- foreach, map, and reduce

### O(log n) - Logarithmic Time ###

- Running time in proportion to the Log of the input size
- run time barelly increases as you exponentially increase the input
- Binary Search

### O(n log n) - Asymptotic Time Complexity ###

- when you need to do work O(log n) for each item
- building perfectly balanced binary tree or traversing a binary tree
- Mergesort / quicksort

### O(n^2) - Quadratic Time ###

- Time is squared size of the output
- commonly double loop
- Bubble Sort
