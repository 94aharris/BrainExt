## Regular Tasks (RT) ##

### Level 1: Initial ###

* No playbook or out of date and unused
* Results are inconsistent
* Different people do tasks differently
* Processes aren't documented
* Requests get lost / stalled
  
### Level 2: Repeatable ###

* There is a finite list of services supported by the team
* Each end-to-end process has enumerated steps with dependencies
* Each end-to-end proces is documented
* Sadly, There is some duplication of effort
* Sadly, some information needed by multiple tasks may be re-created
  
### Level 3: Defined ###

* The team has an SLA defined for most Requests
* Each step has a QA checklist 
* Teams learn of precess changes by other teams ahead of time
* There is no or minimal duplication of effort
* Ability to turn up new capacity is repeatable
  
### Level 4: Managed ###

* Defined SLA is measured
* There are feedback mechanisms for all Steps
* There is periodic review of defects / reworks (e.g. weeklly)
* Postmortems are broadly published within a given time period
* Periodic review of alerts by affected and cross functional teams
* Process change requests require data to measure the problem being fixed
* Dashboards report data in business terms (not just technical)
* Every 'failover procedure' has a 'date of last use' dashboard
* Capacity needs are predicted ahead of time
  
### Level 5: Optimizing ###

* After process changes are made, before / after data is compared to determine success
* Process changes are reverted if before / after data shows no imporovment
* Process changes that have been acted on come from a variety of sources
* Cycle time enjoys month over month improvement
* Decisions are supported by modeling "What if" scenarios using extracted actual data
