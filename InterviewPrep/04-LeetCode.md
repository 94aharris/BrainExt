## Overview ##

- Use a dynamic programming language. My choice is **Python** 
  - Maybe shake the rust off Java and C# just to say be able to 'hello world'
  - Would **love** to use PowerShell instead... but oh well
- Prioritize simplicity and readability over performance first then Optimize

## Interview Overview ##

- Different errors matter differently
  - linkedlist.add() vs linkedlist.insert()
    - Not as bad, just means you don't use linkedlist methods all the time
  - Mistaking = and ==
    - Bad, you don't code often. Mistaking assignment vs comparison

- Practice Whiteboard coding with someone in the room
- If you notice you are quiet, take a step back and say your thought proccess, otherwise the interviewer may try to give you a hint
- Say **something**, even if it is just mumbles

## 7 Steps to Solving Algorithm Problems ##

1. Listen
2. Example
3. Brute Force
4. Optimize
5. Walk Through
6. Implement
7. Test

-----

## STAR Method ##

### **Situation** ###

- Background and context
- Understand the problem

### **Task** ###

- Describe the problem and challenges
- Describe brute force solution

### **Action** ###

- Do the work
- Explain what you did

### **Results** ###

- State benefits, value, Big O, etc.
- State possible improvments

-----

## General Tips ##

- If the brute force solution leads you to O(n^2) try Sort then work for a O(n log n) solution (potentially)
