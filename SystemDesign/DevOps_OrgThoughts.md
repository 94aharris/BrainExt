* Devops summarized as CALMS
  * Culture
  * Automation
  * Lean
  * Measurement
  * Sharing
  
### Culture ###

* DevOps is a Tao
  * You can't be it
  * You can't buy it
  * You can package it 
  * It is a way
  * It is a practice
* You have to start small, and achieve buy in with wins
  * Scorecard your organization and re-evaluate every quarter
* The first and formost priority is to align Managers, Development, and Operations teams to the same set of objectives, the #1 of which being improving the scorecard standing
  * The teams self score and not based on metrics (that could be gamed)
  * BLAMELESS environment, the goal is not to establish blame but to improve the teams and organizations
* Do you need SRE? It might be overkill for your org. It is hard do do correctly without a high degree of competency

### Automation ###

* Everything in Source Code
* Dev -> Test -> Production
* Infrastructure as code
* Grid of 'Develop' / 'Manually do' / 'Purchase Software' / 'Outsource'

### Lean ###

* Eliminate Low Value Activities and move quickly
* Continuous Integration
* Embracing faillure
* Blameless PostMortems
  
### Measurement ###

* Measuring Use and Outcomes are Key
* Suggested Metrics
  * Typical SRE Infrastructure Metrics
  * Time from Dev to Prod
  * Bug / Failure Rate
  * MTBF (Mean Time Between Failure) / MTTR (Mean Time to Repair) / MTTF (Mean Time To Failure)
  
### Sharing ###

* Share responsibility and success
* The people who build an application should be involved in shipping and running it
