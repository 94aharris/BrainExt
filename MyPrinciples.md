# My Principles

These are the principles I am trying to live by. I don't always suceed, and these are a work in progress.
I will add and change as I learn and grow. Each is just as important.

## 1. Think About Others First 

Think about others first when making decisions. This does not mean neglect yourself, but it does mean do not be self centered.
Start with others then 'work backwards'. Work vigorously to earn and keep others trust.
Family First.

## 2. Use Each Minute to The Fullest

Every minute is just as valuable as the next. There are no default 'productive' and 'un-productive' minutes, only what you make of them.
This does not mean do not rest or relax, but it means do so intentionally. Idling to just 'pass the time' is a road to wasted years.

## 3. Take Ownership

Take ownership of your tasks, do not say 'that's not my job'. When you take ownership, do the task to the fullest. Do not short sell or compromise just because you face difficulties.

## 4. Learn Continuously and Deeply

Always seek to improve yourself. Stay exceedingly curious and dive below the surface, do not be satisfied by shallow information.

## 5. Be Truthful, Candid, and Strong

Listen Attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. Be self-critical even when embarrasing. Do not let this make you weak. Keep a strong backbone when you believe you are right.

## 6. Have a Bias for Action and Follow Through

Speed matters in decisions and many decisions are reversible. Take calculated risk, and take action quickly. Just Build It! The things you want to put off because they are 'uncomfortable' are usually the most important. When you take action, own it and follow through until the action is completely done.

## 7. Uplift Others

Train and improve those around you and bring their accomplishments to light. Amazing things do not happen alone, bring those you train along with you.

## 8. Think Big and Act Big

Do not settle for 'mediocre', aim for great things. Treat anything you are working on as a 'great thing'. Do not think a task is mediocre and give it mediocre effort.

## 9. Act with Passion

Life is already to bland. Be passionate.

## 10. Be Concise and Communicate Well

Do not talk just to talk. Say what you are trying to communicate and be done. Be sure you know what you are talking about.

## 11. Be a Master of Your Domain

Know what you are talking about and have the data to back it up. Do not hand wave specifics, write them down! The devil is in the details.

## 12. Take Notes Constantly

My brain is a sieve. Take notes constantly, especially for tasks that matter.
